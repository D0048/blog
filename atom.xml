This operation is usually just a meaningless scaling by a constant unless it is performed across channels, which is usually called a cascade cross channel pooling layer. </p><h2 id="What’s-the-purpose"><a href="#What’s-the-purpose" class="headerlink" title="What’s the purpose?"></a>What’s the purpose?</h2><p>Along all materials read, it seems like this operation is widely used on the following purposes:</p><h3 id="Dimension-augmentation-reduction"><a href="#Dimension-augmentation-reduction" class="headerlink" title="Dimension augmentation/reduction."></a>Dimension augmentation/reduction.</h3><p>This operation is capable of mapping an input of any channel to an output of any channel while preserving the original size of the picture. Do be aware that such operation, especially in dimensionality augmentations, uses large amount of extra parameters, making the network possible more prone to overfitting.</p><h3 id="Rescaling-the-last-layer"><a href="#Rescaling-the-last-layer" class="headerlink" title="Rescaling the last layer."></a>Rescaling the last layer.</h3><p>In the above it’s mentioned that 1x1 convolution could serve as a plain scale of a whole channel, which is usually unnecessary. However, if such need exist, it could be met though this operation.</p><h3 id="Increasing-non-linearity"><a href="#Increasing-non-linearity" class="headerlink" title="Increasing non-linearity."></a>Increasing non-linearity.</h3><p>The fact that it involves a non-linear mapping without drastically altering the input, the non-linearity of the network is increased without using plain fully-connected layers which destroys the relationship between nearby pixels.</p><h3 id="The-Network-in-Network-NIN-Structure"><a href="#The-Network-in-Network-NIN-Structure" class="headerlink" title="The (Network in Network)NIN Structure"></a>The (Network in Network)NIN Structure</h3><p>This concept first appeared to me while reading a research paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4400v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">network in network</a>, which seems to be another powerful modification made on CNNs. One of the key aspect this paper adapted is using a multilayer perceptron model to replace the traditional convolution kernel. </p><p>As I wonder how could this model be implemented using higher level api of popular machine learning libraries without modifying the lower level codes, the paper actually stated that such operation of sliding a mini-MLP over a picture across the previous channels is equivalent to cross channel convolution with 1x1 kernels, where a few new 1x1 convolutional layer(CCCP) is appended to a normal convolutional layer to reach the goal.</p><p>The fact that this CCCP operation appending to a normal convolution layers will make a equivalent MLP serves as a sliding convolution kernel, is hard to imagine to be true. It creates confusion in my understanding and it is not until I unroll the whole process so it could be under stood.</p><p>Rather than 2d convolution, using 1d convolution makes things more straight forward while the same rule applies to arbitrary dimensions of convolution.</p><p>Suppose we have an 1d input with 2 channels:</p>]]></content>

Every term of the series after the first is the harmonic mean of the neighboring terms; the phrase harmonic mean likewise derives from music.</p></blockquote><p>It is basically a series defined like this:<br>$$<br>\sum_{x=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\infty}<br>$$<br>and it feels, intuitively, to be converging. However, it’s actually the opposite.</p><h2 id="Why-are-they-diverging"><a href="#Why-are-they-diverging" class="headerlink" title="Why are they diverging?"></a>Why are they diverging?</h2><h3 id="Mathematical-Perspective"><a href="#Mathematical-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Mathematical Perspective"></a>Mathematical Perspective</h3><p>There are multiple ways to think about it and I find the following the easiest to understand.</p><ol><li>Use $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ to regress the series and take an infinite integral:<br>$$<br>\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) dx = ln(x)<br>$$</li><li>From  the above, if we are taking a finite integral<br>$$<br>ln(x)|_{1}^{\infty} = \infty<br>$$<br>, we can see that the result diverges into infinity.</li></ol><h3 id="Intuitive-Understanding"><a href="#Intuitive-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Intuitive Understanding"></a>Intuitive Understanding</h3><p>Even if the fact that this series is diverging seems to be mathematically correct, it’s really weird to think about it. Here’s an intuitive way of thinking it.</p><p>For any infinite series, think of is as doing two things together:</p><ul><li>The fact it’s “infinite” is trying to push the sum of it into $\infty$, in another word, divergence.</li><li>The fact that there is an altered term in every new sum added, is trying to push the sum into a finite value by making the newly generated value as small as possible, thus converging.</li></ul><p>And here we have a race between the two forces and by comparing the speed of change the two forces create, we know what’s the result. </p><p>Let’s look at a similar series, that looks a lot alike to our series but actually converges.<br>$$<br>\sum_{x=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^n} = \frac{1}{1^n} + \frac{1}{2^n} + \frac{1}{3^n} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\infty^n}<br>$$<br>The $n$ here is the key and in the Harmonic Series it equals 1. At here, let’s use $n=2$ as an example to create our new series.<br>$$<br>\sum_{x=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\infty^2}<br>$$<br>Over the course of adding the first term to the $\infty^{st}$ term, looking at the <code>first</code> force, we have a course of:</p><ul><li>1 -&gt; $\infty$ with step length of 1<br>(Adding one more term each iteration)<br>Over the course of adding the first term to the $\infty^{st}$ term, looking at the <code>second</code> force, we have a course of:</li><li>1 -&gt; $\infty$ with step length of $\frac{1}{x^2-(x-1)^2}$, which proved to be $\frac{1}{step_{x-1}+2}$.<br>(Since we are comparing the force of shrinking a value, we can ignore the upper part of the fraction, which makes the step ${step_{x-1}+2}$)<br>For example, the steps between term_1, 2, 3, 4 are 3, 5 and 7.</li></ul><p>This way, we can compare the first force with the second:<br>$$<br>\frac{1}{step_{x-1}+2} &lt; 0<br>$$<br>which means in all steps the speed convergence of this series is larger than the speed of divergence, which makes its overall behavior convergence. </p><p>Let’s look at another example series where <code>n=0.5</code>:<br>$$<br>\sum_{x=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{0.5}} = \frac{1}{1^{0.5}} + \frac{1}{2^{0.5}} + \frac{1}{3^{0.5}} + \ldots + \frac{1}{\infty^{0.5}}<br>$$<br>(The steps between term_1, 2, 3, 4 are 0.4, 0.3 and 0.25.)<br>And compare the two forces of it:<br>$$<br>\frac{1}{(x^{0.5}-(x-1)^{0.5})^2} &gt; 0<br>$$<br>which means in all steps the speed convergence of this series is smaller than the speed of divergence, which makes its overall behavior divergence. </p><p>Finally, time to deal with our <code>n=1</code> series. We surprisingly found that the speed of divergence is equal to the speed of convergence, which make it lies at the critical area that yet to be defined. </p><p>However, we know that a series have to be either converges or diverges. Think of it like this: a man chasing another man holding a finish line, both of them are at the same speed. The fact that they are chasing each other makes sure the finish line is ahead of the man. This way, the man never gets to the finish line, thus making the final pattern diverges. </p><p>To draw a conclusion:<br>$$<br>\sum_{x=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^n}$$ Converges only if $n&gt;0$</p><h2 id="Extending-the-question"><a href="#Extending-the-question" class="headerlink" title="Extending the question"></a>Extending the question</h2><p>From the above we can tell that the Harmonic Series indeed diverges, but at the critical speed where any tiny change in its speed of divergence/convergence could knock it into another side. What about we try to give it a knock?<br>These problem has already been discussed and the modified series are called Depleted Harmonic Series. </p><p>It’s easy to conclude that changes like pulling away all the recipicals of odd numbers will cause this series to converge. </p><h3 id="Prime-Numbers"><a href="#Prime-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="Prime Numbers?"></a>Prime Numbers?</h3><p>What about pulling away all the recipicals of prime numbers? I heard from a guy on a forum that it still diverges, but I haven’t read any proves. </p><p>This sounds really anti-intuitive because we are excluding an infinite series out of another infinite series(Really? Not proved yet…) where its divergence speed is too low that any reduction will cause it to converge.</p><p>There is yet another possible way of thinking this.</p><p>Due to the unknowns of prime numbers, I will replace them with “any series that gets sparser as it grows”. We know that making a series of all the terms pulled out, this new series actually converges. So we are excluding a finite value out of infinite, which still, equals infinite.</p><p>I can almost immidiently feel that a lot of my logics are really sloppy, please point out if anything is wrong. </p><p>2017/10/17</p><p>Update: ok… my understanding seems to be a bit off. It’s still possible to extract a divergent series out of it to make it still diverges…<br>2017/10/19</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Classifying handwritten digits, from the traditional view of machine learning, using the Mnist dataset as an example, indeed classifying points on a (28*28=784) dimensional space into 10 separate classes, which is not necessarily linear seperateable .  </p><p>And the neural network we constructed (the most classical one, with a few fully-connected layers), is no difference than the fancier version of this program:  </p><p>The program above basically works like this:  <a href="https://github.com/D0048/makeyourownneuralnetwork/blob/master/better_detection/train.py" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/D0048/makeyourownneuralnetwork/blob/master/better_detection/train.py</a></p><p>Imagine every picture in the training data set as an 28cm*28cm steal plate, where the darker areas are higher and the whiter areas are lower, with the elevation from 0cm to 255 cm (since the color value ranges from 0~255), or in another way more friendly to calculations, -127.5cm~+127.5cm.  Every steal plate should have an label with it for identification. </p><p>Generated image looks somehow like this (generated from <a href="http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/</a>): </p><p>Label: 5 </p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D0048/makeyourownneuralnetwork/master/better_detection/2828_my_own_5.png" width="200" height="200"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D0048/makeyourownneuralnetwork/master/better_detection/5-3d.png" width="200" height="200"></p><p><br><br>Also, let we create another soft plate made of clay, specifically for the digit ‘5’, where all the initial elevations are 0. </p><p>Then, we collect all the steal plates in the training set labeled “5”, where the total number of them is marked as ‘m’. Smooth each of the steal plates in a scale of 1/m so that all the plates add up to be one plate. For example, the pixel with elevation 125 need to be smoothed into 125/m and the pixel with elevation –123 need to be smoothed into -125/m.  </p><p>After the steal plates are processed, we push it one by one on the clay model we prepared with matrix subtractions. There need to be a total of 10 plates for each digit. </p><p>At last, we pull out an random plate from the training set without reading the label on it, and push it into each of the 10 clay plates we prepare earlier corresponding to each digits, and measure the friction we meet push the steel plate into the clay. The one clay plate with the lowest friction while pushing our test sample inside is supposing to be corresponding to the actual digit represented by the sample.  </p><p>However, these current clay plates-“models” I call them-does not works well at all, considering the fact the a flat clay plate with elevation of –126 will give an virtually zero friction while applied by any sample and the more trainings are applied on a model, the more likely is the model to become flat and blurry and muddy thus making classification under satisfaction.  </p><p>One way to ease the problem is to reverse the rest of the training dataset that does not match the model so that the highest peek now become the lowest valley and apply them to this model again. However, this won’t address the issue from foundation and could somehow make the model more mushy.  </p><p>That’s the reason where the advantages of the neural network comes in, and why I called the neural network “a fancier version”. Basically, a neural network allows us to configure specific weights to each pixel so that the white areas around the actual digit (virtually) no longer contributes to the total friction (called error using former language)  and the black pixels shared by multiple digits, instead of a mess of blurry in our setup, contributes to the total friction in a smarter way, which is more like a black box. By making use of the multi-layer structure, we got a really flexible model that allows certain combination of pixels contributing to the final friction in a unified whole. Also, we can adapt universal methods like gradient descent to select the best weights for each neuron.  </p><p>However, this sounds a little bit strange and anti-intuitive: do we really need to map everything into such a high-dimensional space, in order to just classify 10 different digits? Neural networks seems to be somehow a mimic of brain, but my brain (at least mine) recognizing a digit does not seems to be relying on almost a thousand discrete features of that specific digit, no need to mention that the size of digits in real life could vary vastly according to multiple factors like distance. Do we really need all these features to perform the classification, or can we just first extract less but more pivotal features out the raw image? </p><p>After consideration, I suppose this means “narrower” networks, while deeper might serves as an compromise to it. Also, this means we may use multiple networks to work together in a chain, while some of them trying to extract the feature “smartly” from the data, and some others to deal with the final decision.  </p><p>It’s not until later that I read about the Convolution Neural Network, which is similar to the better neural network in my mind, as what descripted earlier. However, this is still not as expected—I expect a model that works more similar to our neural system, where it should be resistant to scaling (Current CNNs are not capable of doing so. A model called spatial transform network claimed to do so, to be researched) and there should not be such huge training set to reach a good performance. </p><p>Using handwritten digits as an example,  is that possible if we design a network to transform the digits into lines or even to Bézier curve. This way, the scaling problem is resolved. Then,  for ever entity, we can extract far more features rather than just pixels: the total number of close areas, the total interceptions… and so on.  This way, rather than letting the network treating a digit as an ambiguous picture(honestly I can’t even learn how to read digits with some 28*28 pictures), we may actually teach the network, in a more fundamental way, of what is a digit anyway.  </p><p>Recent new idea above, to be tested.  </p><p>Add:</p><p>Now I have somewhat more understanding on CNNs, and find them really powerful. However, it still somehow lack of resistance to size shift of objects. I have the following idea of improvement to be tested:</p><ol><li><p>Give the lower level features to CNNs, (like “does the sample have handle”), which matches our intuitive understanding, but use logic trees and other traditional machine learning methods to make the higher level decisions (like “is the sample a water bottle”), which matches our comprehensional understanding of objects. This may also prevent the network to use irrelevant features limited by the data in the training set. </p></li><li><p>Try different and irregular shapes of reception field, rather than just square. </p></li><li><p>Use another network like RNN to adjust learning rate. </p></li></ol>]]></content>

Overall, such observation is a good thing to have since it make everyone’s life easier.  </p><p>However, this could actually cause many security/privacy issues. Using my experience in the summer camp as an example, where we were asked to perform all our developments on an “environment” made by a company called Apicloud(As I was told, there are tons of similar platforms available but they are essentially the same thing). This is a platform where you can create gui phone applications using simple js language and the api the company provided. All the low level code are packaged into so-called “modules”(named by the company). The key point is, those modules are provided by third party, non-open source, and not even accessible to the ones who use it. All the so-called “compilation and build” are performed online, by uploading user code to a repo binds to this user’s account and send an build request over a webpage panel.  </p><p>This is actually a really bad signal—developers no longer know what happened to the project and they just upload their code(more like pseudo-code thou) and depending on some third-party companies in responsible for the rest. One shall never know what has been added into one’s application packages to make an 3-line hello world program larger than 30mb and starts automatically on phone boot. What might be inside? Backdoors? ADs? Or user trackers? We shall never know! Moreover, the account of every developer is forced to bonded to his/er phone number, which is further forced to bonded to his/er ID number. This way, it would be a huge privacy issue in that the gov shall now know who, at where is making those applications, and have the total ability to disable one’s ability to further produce/use any applications by deleting his/er account and disable their applications.  </p><p>This way, users and developers are all losing their control over their applications, instead giving the right to some kinds of third-party organization! </p><p>Moreover, according to my observation, tons of popular, rather lower scale applications, are all based on similar platforms!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While using this function, there’s a lot that’s mentioned in the manual but hard to find.</p><p>From manual:</p><pre>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE        /* See feature_test_macros(7) */#include <unistd.h>char *crypt(const char *key, const char *salt);#define _GNU_SOURCE          /* See feature_test_macros(7) */#include <crypt.h>char *crypt_r(const char *key, const char *salt,struct crypt_data *data);Link with -lcrypt.</crypt.h></unistd.h></pre><p>However:</p><pre>The return value points to static data whose contentis overwritten by each call.</pre>This means a strdup or similar operation is necessary to copy it if one want to preserve the value and use the previous after another crypt. Also, it is not in the manual that using an encrypted string as salt means using the same salt that encrypts the string is used to encrypt the new one. The reason is that the string output will have its own salt at its beginning. The manual mentions nothing about how the check works but it works at here. So I looked for the source code in c posix library(From here:https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/crypt/crypt-entry.c.html#crypt):<pre>157    char *158    crypt (const char *key, const char *salt)159    {160    #ifdef _LIBC161      /* Try to find out whether we have to use MD5 encryption replacement.  */162      if (strncmp (md5_salt_prefix, salt, sizeof (md5_salt_prefix) - 1) == 0163          /* Let __crypt_r deal with the error code if FIPS is enabled.  */164          && !fips_enabled_p ())165        return __md5_crypt (key, salt);166    167      /* Try to find out whether we have to use SHA256 encryption replacement.  */168      if (strncmp (sha256_salt_prefix, salt, sizeof (sha256_salt_prefix) - 1) == 0)169        return __sha256_crypt (key, salt);170    171      /* Try to find out whether we have to use SHA512 encryption replacement.  */172      if (strncmp (sha512_salt_prefix, salt, sizeof (sha512_salt_prefix) - 1) == 0)173        return __sha512_crypt (key, salt);174    #endif175    176      return __crypt_r (key, salt, &_ufc_foobar);177    }</pre><p>It seems to be smarter than I excepted and can even determine which way to encrypt according to the salt….</p><p>2017/6/13</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When 2 <code>.h</code> files are trying to use classes in each other, an error will occur if no special treatment is applied:</p><pre> syntax error : identifier "class_name"</pre>It seems like the compiler identify the class as an identifier. I tried to use macro commands like the following <pre>#ifndef PACKAGE#include "Package.h"#define PACKAGE#endif</pre>==But failed.==With the help of this [passage](http://www.bijishequ.com/detail/149692?p=), I found a way to solve it. A class in C++ can be first declared and then defined like this:<pre>class class_name;//this is a declaration.class class_name{    Content contents;};//this is a definition</pre><p>So by putting only the declaration of classes in the header files or by putting another declaration of the class before use, it is made possible for this problem to be solved.</p>]]></content>

    <title>MACHINE LEARNING ARE REALLY ADVANCING THESE DAYS</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I formed a strong interest on machine learning in that it provides a new way to view the relationship between how programs view the world and how we view the world. Even if digging the detail requires a strong math knowledge, which I don’t have yet, by reading basic concepts, I can have a grasp of the idea. I believe it might be the future of computers.</p><p>Leave out how this subject is powerful since I am just beginning my first contact with it, let’s look at how much has been done through it. For example, it allows programs to learn from the past and form new knowledge. I went through a paper called “Major Life Event Extraction from Twitter based on Congratulations/Condolences Speech Acts” and I found that a lot more could be done with appropriate machine learning strategies. It is almost unimaginable before for a program to identify intents inside texts used by humans and now it’s made possible by machine learning. That’s cool.</p>]]></content>
